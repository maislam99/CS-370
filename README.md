# CS-370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

- We were provided with code that represented the environment of the maze, methods needed to store data for experience replays, 
  the structure of the neural network, and the method that determine if a win condition is reached.


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

-Computer scientists combine different tecnological frameworks with knowledge of data structures and algorithms to model and solve problems for users.
The applications designed by computer scientists allow problems that would take a long time or a large team to be solved to be solved quickly by more people. 


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

-The first step to approaching a problem is to define inputs and outputs of a system and determine how the data should be modeled.
Next, a programming lanuage or other framework is chosen to complement the data being used. Finally, an algorithm is developed to 
transform the data into a useful output. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

-The ethical responsibility of a computer scientist to the end user and organization is to provide a working solution
that accomplishes their goals, is within the law, does not present security risks, and does not harm any other person who may be 
affected by the program.
